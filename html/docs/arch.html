<h3>Software isolation</h3>
<p>All kernel components, device drivers and user applications execute in a single
    address space and unrestricted kernel mode (CPU ring 0). Protection and isolation
    are provided by software. Kernel uses builtin V8 engine to compile JavaScript into
    trusted native code. This guarantees only safe JavaScript code is actually executable.</p>
<p>Every program runs in it's own sandboxed context and uses limited set of resources.</p>

<h3>Multitasking</h3>
<p>Runtime.JS uses global non-blocking event loop to dispatch tasks for the whole system. Preemption
    is supported by design (and by V8), but haven't been implemented yet.</p>
<p>System runs one instance of V8 virtual machine (V8 isolate) per core.</p>

<h3>IPC</h3>
<p>Kernel implements remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism for inter-process communication.
    Functions, ArrayBuffers and other objects are supported as RPC arguments.</p>
<p>ArrayBuffers are transferred by default, and it's impossible to share memory between programs.
To send a copy of ArrayBuffer you need to clone it explicitly.</p>
